= Setup

Scripts to setup Linux.

* Whenever there is a version information needed to install, use following:
** `<txt>\_VERSION=<version>`
** for example: `PYTHON_VERSION=3.10.2`
** all variables having "\_VERSION=" are used to print version info when starting the container
* Directories:
** both - used both in container and non-container
** container - only when using in container
** non-container - only when using non-container
* script names like `XXX-scriptname.sh`
** where XXX starts from: 
*** 000 when script is for both
*** 100 when script is for container
*** 200 when script is for non-container
** must end with .sh
* Execute `sh setup-everything-non-container.sh` to install everything on freshly installed RHEL based Linux.
